PhoneBook Management System
Project Overview

The PhoneBook Management System we created, is a Java-based application which is created to manage a list of contacts using an ArrayList. It provides basic functionalities such as adding, editing, searching, deleting, and displaying contact information. The system operates without a database, instead using an ArrayList to store contacts dynamically during runtime.

Features
•	Add Contact: Allows users to create and store new contact information in an ArrayList.
•	Edit Contact: Enables users to modify existing contact information stored in the list.
•	Delete Contact: Removes contact details from the ArrayList.
•	Search Contact: Provides functionality to search for a contact by name or other criteria.
•	Display All Contacts: Displays a list of all stored contacts within the ArrayList.
•	Login Functionality: Simple user authentication before accessing the phonebook management system.

Installation and Setup
